# Practical 4: EC2 User Data and Load Balancer

## Steps Performed
1. Launched 2 EC2 instances with user data:
   - Server1 user-data: “My first website on server1”
   - Server2 user-data: “My first website on server2”
   - Verified Apache installation and index.html creation.
2. Modified Security Group:
   - Added HTTP rule (MyIP).
   - Kept default rule unchanged.
3. Accessed EC2 instances via Public IP:
   - Verified websites working in browser.
4. Created Application Load Balancer:
   - Configured health check path `/index.html`.
   - Created Target Group and registered instances.
   - Accessed application via ELB DNS name.
5. Verified Target Group health:
   - Instances showed healthy.
   - Configured stickiness and tested session persistence.
6. Explored path-based routing:
   - Launched 4 EC2 instances:
     - 2 with `/index.html` (APP-TG).
     - 2 with `/admin` (Admin-TG).
   - Configured listener rules:
     - Path `/admin` → forward to Admin-TG.
7. Reviewed ELB Actions and Target Group Actions.
8. Stopped one EC2 instance:
   - Verified ELB continued routing traffic to healthy targets.
9. Terminated EC2 instances, Load Balancer, and Target Groups.

## Notes
- User data automates instance setup (Apache + HTML files).
- Security Groups must allow HTTP for web access.
- Load Balancer distributes traffic and ensures high availability.
- Health checks confirm instance readiness.
- Stickiness maintains session affinity for users.
- Path-based routing enables multiple applications under one ELB.
- Stopping one instance proves ELB fault tolerance.
- Always clean up ELB, Target Groups, and instances to avoid charges.
