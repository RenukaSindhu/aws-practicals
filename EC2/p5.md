# Practical 5: EC2 Auto Scaling

## Steps Performed
1. Created Application Load Balancer (ALB) with empty Target Group:
   - Configured Security Group with HTTP rule.
   - Ensured default rule allowed all traffic.
2. Created Launch Template:
   - Selected AMI ID.
   - Added user-data script for Apache setup and index.html.
3. Created Auto Scaling Group (ASG) from Launch Template:
   - Defined min, desired capacity (DC), and max values.
   - Verified registered targets in Target Group were healthy.
4. Accessed ELB DNS name:
   - Tested manual scaling (adjusted desired capacity).
   - Tested scheduled scaling (configured scaling policy).
   - Performed instance refresh.
   - Terminated EC2 instances manually to observe ASG behavior.
5. Modified User Data:
   - Created new Launch Template with updated user-data.
   - Updated ASG to use new template.
   - Verified application update via same ELB URL.
6. Tested ASG recovery:
   - Terminated all EC2 instances manually.
   - Observed ASG relaunching instances based on Desired Capacity or Min size.
7. Deleted resources:
   - Auto Scaling Group.
   - Launch Template.
   - Load Balancer and Target Group.

## Notes
- Auto Scaling ensures high availability by maintaining desired capacity.
- Launch Templates standardize instance configuration.
- Manual scaling allows quick adjustments; scheduled scaling automates capacity changes.
- Instance refresh updates running instances with new configurations.
- ASG automatically replaces terminated instances based on Min/Desired settings.
- Updating user-data via new Launch Template propagates changes across ASG.
- Always delete unused ASG, Launch Templates, and ELBs to avoid charges.
